# Particle-IOT-Tower-Light
Tower Light IOT controller based around the Particle Photon. This firmware was very quickly put together and may not be the most efficent software available but it gets the job done. It was designed for the <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/2993">Tower Light - Red Yellow Green Alert Light with Buzzer</a> from <a href="adafruit.com">Adafruit</a>. It also supports different tower lights that have less lights or no buzzer through configuration.

<b>Better documentation will be added later!<b/>
